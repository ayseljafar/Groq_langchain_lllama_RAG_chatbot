Artificial Intelligence Overview

AI (Artificial Intelligence) is the simulation of human intelligence by machines. Here are some key concepts:

1. Machine Learning
Machine learning is a subset of AI that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It uses statistical techniques to give computers the ability to "learn" with data.

2. Deep Learning
Deep learning is a type of machine learning based on artificial neural networks. It's particularly good at:
- Image recognition
- Natural language processing
- Speech recognition
- Pattern detection

3. Natural Language Processing (NLP)
NLP is the ability of computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. Applications include:
- Machine translation
- Chatbots
- Text summarization
- Sentiment analysis

4. Computer Vision
Computer vision enables machines to understand and process visual information from the world, similar to human vision. It's used in:
- Facial recognition
- Object detection
- Autonomous vehicles
- Medical image analysis

5. Robotics
Robotics combines AI with mechanical engineering to create machines that can perform physical tasks. Applications include:
- Manufacturing automation
- Surgery assistance
- Space exploration
- Home assistance
